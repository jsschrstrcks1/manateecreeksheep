# It replaced a hard-coded `/home/user/ken/.claude/hooks/observe-tool-use.sh`,
# which resolves on a Linux container and NOT on the operator's Mac — while the
# same settings file carried `HOUSEHOLD_OCS_ROOT=/Users/kenbaker/atlas-serve`,
# which resolves on the Mac and not in the container. Two machine-absolute paths
# in one file, each dead on the other machine, both silently (UL-337/UL-173).

# FAIL LOUD, NOT FATAL — household posture, operator directive 2026-08-10.
# A missing observation hook must SAY so on stderr; it must never take a session
# down, because observation capture is not a safety gate. Contrast the
# dangerous-command guard, which is fail-CLOSED on purpose: loud is about whether
# it can be missed, fatal is about whether work proceeds. Always exits 0.
